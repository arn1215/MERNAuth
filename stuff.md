need to add date of event to event schema

DONE
When i click on an event, I will send that event to the store.
now that I am on the event page i will render the data from that slice


When I enter x amount in the number input AND click add to cart => => => I want to create a ticket document x times 
I want to create a Cart view => => => users can see a running total of all tickets where the isPaid boolean is false


create a new store slice that is called searchItems
make this identical to the events slice 

when a button is pressed enter the search query and hit that endpoint
